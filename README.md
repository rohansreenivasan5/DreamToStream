## About DreamToStream
Dream to Stream is an application that combines the Shows and Movie tables from Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video. With the provided data, users now have a centralized area to see whatâ€™s available to them. Using our application dreamToStream, users can create, retrieve, update, and delete their Show and Movie ratings, see what Movie/Show are available to them in their country, and do a mesh with a fellow user to see comparisons between Movies and Shows both have rated.
