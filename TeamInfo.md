## Project Summary

Our project is a website that is used to rate different shows/movies on multiple streaming services. When you open Netflix or any other streaming service, it will show you the top ten movies in your region, but that is based on data they collect from show interaction. This may not always be a great representation of what people actually thought of the show. Therefore, we want to make a website that can show you any number of shows/movies from multiple categories and allow you to rate the media you have watched. 

This website will be different from other sites like Rotten Tomatoes because it is not for movie critics to provide a whole explanation of the movie, rather just a simple rating based on their opinion. Social media generates a lot of hype around shows/movies and this site will help users determine what is actually worth the hype. Our application hopes to provide users an enjoyable experience while browsing for what their next watch is without having to worry about taking a risk on a “hyped-up” series and wasting their time watching something they might not enjoy.
